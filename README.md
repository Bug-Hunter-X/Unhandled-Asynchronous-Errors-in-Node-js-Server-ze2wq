# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers: silently ignoring errors within asynchronous operations.  The server should gracefully handle these errors, preventing crashes and providing meaningful feedback to clients.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTTP server that performs an asynchronous operation. If this operation fails, the error is caught but not handled properly, resulting in the server continuing to operate but without notifying the client.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version.  It includes proper error handling by sending an appropriate error response to the client if the asynchronous operation fails.
